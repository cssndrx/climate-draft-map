We sequester sludgy organic wastes (biosolids, manure, agricultural, food waste, paper sludge, etc.) that today are sent to a landfill, dumped into an ocean/river, land applied, or otherwise left to decompose, releasing GHGs into the atmosphere. Vaulted leverages a suite of patented, mature, geologic slurry sequestration technologies which allow us to sequester organic waste with minimal processing. We inject deep under the earth\u2019s surface, where the carbon is permanently trapped under a layer of impermeable rock - the same formations that have kept hydrocarbons underground for millions of years. We have two permitted, operational, facilities allowing us to reach near-term meaningful scale. Our carbon removal approach goes beyond vaulting carbon. It inherently improves local environmental and human health. In doing so, our operations redress historically unjust waste management practices and advance environmental justice.

Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don\u2019t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics.
