It spurs the market shift towards affordable green concrete, by enabling concrete manufacturers to convert waste CO2 into solid minerals, locked away as a solid within concrete during manufacturing. It is a green building technology company currently serving concrete product manufacturers in the US and Canada. It offers concrete producers the ability to manufacture green concrete products without compromising on either quality or price. CarbonCure is a retrofit innovation that repurposes CO2 gas from large final emitters as a feedstock in concrete plants. The gas is permanently converted into embedded solid mineral carbonates that yield material, environmental, and production advantages. By enabling concrete manufacturers to consume CO2 into concrete products during manufacturing, the technology differentiates an otherwise traditional commodity concrete product, while achieving superior material performance characteristics. In addition to technology, CarbonCure provides demand-pull marketing and environmental reporting/certification services to reinforce its customers\u2019 exclusive competitive positioning. The technology is licensed at a very low-CAPEX to concrete producers, generating a recurring revenue stream.

We sequester sludgy organic wastes (biosolids, manure, agricultural, food waste, paper sludge, etc.) that today are sent to a landfill, dumped into an ocean/river, land applied, or otherwise left to decompose, releasing GHGs into the atmosphere. Vaulted leverages a suite of patented, mature, geologic slurry sequestration technologies which allow us to sequester organic waste with minimal processing. We inject deep under the earth\u2019s surface, where the carbon is permanently trapped under a layer of impermeable rock - the same formations that have kept hydrocarbons underground for millions of years. We have two permitted, operational, facilities allowing us to reach near-term meaningful scale. Our carbon removal approach goes beyond vaulting carbon. It inherently improves local environmental and human health. In doing so, our operations redress historically unjust waste management practices and advance environmental justice.

They use our Routing-API to power solutions for individual EV-drivers and EV-fleets; owned, leased, rented, shared, and autonomous. Our routing engine uses over 15 different (dynamic) variables to calculate the real-time range of any EV (currently 260+ EV models). Proprietary algorithms then compute the best route from A, to B (to C, to D) with the optimal charge stations in between; specific to that vehicle, to that journey, business logic, and fleet specs. Build-in predictive models optimize for total travel-time and travel-costs. Chargetrip\u2019s API is easy to integrate into existing charge-, navigation-, Fleet operating, and telematics applications. On average, over 175.000 EV drivers use our software every month; equal to 10% of all EV\u2019s in Europe.",
